# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all contributors to foster an open, welcoming, and inclusive community. We are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, ethnicity, nationality, or religion.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Providing constructive feedback with kindness and encouragement.
- Accepting responsibility for mistakes and learning from them.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project.
- Showing empathy toward others.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome advances.
- Insulting, derogatory, or offensive comments or personal attacks.
- Public or private harassment of any kind.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission.
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for upholding the standards of this Code of Conduct and will address any inappropriate behavior promptly and fairly. Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove comments, code, contributions, and other interactions that do not comply with this Code of Conduct or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor whose behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, mailing lists, and other forms of communication that the project uses. It also applies when representing the project or community in public spaces or at events.

## Reporting Violations

If you observe or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by emailing [your email address]. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and confidentially.

When reporting, please include any relevant details, such as links, screenshots, and descriptions of the behavior. The maintainers commit to maintaining confidentiality and taking appropriate action based on the report.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face repercussions. For confirmed violations, the maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, removing them from the project, or, in severe cases, contacting legal authorities. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at legal@sixthflow.com.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.
