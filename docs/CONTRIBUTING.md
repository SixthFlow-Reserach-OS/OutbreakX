Welcome! We’re thrilled that you’re interested in contributing to **OutbreakX**. Contributions from the community are essential to the success of any open-source project, and we appreciate your time and effort.

## Getting Started

1. **Check Open Issues**: Look through the [issues](https://github.com/SixthFlow-Reserach-OS/OutbreakX/issues)  to see if there are any that interest you. We label issues with tags like `good first issue`, `help wanted`, and `enhancement` to help guide new contributors.
   
2. **Choose an Issue or Suggest an Idea**:
   - Comment on an open issue to let us know you're working on it. This prevents duplicate work.

## Code of Conduct

## How to Contribute

Here's the corrected markdown for that section:

---
### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

   First, [fork the repository](https://github.com/SixthFlow-Reserach-OS/OutbreakX.git) and clone it locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OutbreakX.git
   cd OutbreakX
   ```

### 2. Set Up the Project

   Follow the [README.md](/README.md) for installation and setup instructions to get the project running locally.

### 3. Create a New Branch

   To keep the main branch clean, create a new branch for your work:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

   **Branch Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names for branches (e.g., `fix-typo`, `feature-new-functionality`).

### 4. Make Your Changes

   **Code Standards**: Follow the coding style used in the project to maintain consistency.

### 5. Add Tests (If Applicable)

   - For bug fixes and new features, add or update tests to ensure that changes work as expected.
   - Refer to the [testing guide](link-to-testing-guide) for more details on writing tests.

### 6. Commit Your Changes

   Write meaningful commit messages that describe your changes concisely:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: corrected typo in README.md"
   ```

   **Commit Message Guidelines**:
   - Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
   - Limit the first line to 50 characters and provide additional detail if necessary.

### 7. Push Your Changes

   Push your branch to your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

### 8. Open a Pull Request

   - Go to the original repository and [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
   - Describe the changes you made and reference any relevant issues (e.g., "Fixes #123").
   - Link to any related issues or discussions and attach screenshots or examples if they clarify your contribution.

### 9. Collaborate and Respond to Feedback

   Our maintainers will review your pull request and may request changes. If so:
   - Make updates in your branch.
   - Commit your changes and push to the same branch; the pull request will automatically update.

## Contribution Types

We welcome all kinds of contributions, including but not limited to:

- **Bug Fixes**: Help us find and resolve issues in the codebase.
- **New Features**: Add functionality that enhances the project.
- **Documentation**: Improve existing documentation or add new sections.
